			<h1 id="suppertedPlatforms">Supported Platforms</h1>

			<h2 id="web">Web-Based Platforms</h2>
			<p>UI Integration Cards provide comprehensive support for web-based applications across desktop and mobile browsers.</p>

			<h3 id="featureSupport">Feature Support</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Complete Feature Set:</strong> All card features are fully supported in web environments, including data binding, actions, filtering, and interactive elements</li>
				<li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Cards automatically adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.</li>
				<li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Consistent experience across modern browsers</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="browserRequirements">Browser Requirements</h3>
			<p>For detailed browser support information, refer to the <a href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser-support</a> documentation of the OpenUI5 framework.</p>


			<h2 id="native">Mobile Native Platforms</h2>
			<p>
				True to the “Write once, use everywhere” principle, the UI Integration Cards are supported on mobile native platforms.<br>
				The mobile native implementation of UI Integration Cards features a built-in JavaScript engine capable of interpreting the same JSON manifest files used in web applications.<br>
				This embedded runtime processes the card definitions uniformly across platforms, ensuring consistent behavior and appearance.<br>
				As a result, developers can maintain a single card definition while achieving native performance and applying platform-specific optimizations on mobile devices.<br>
			</p>

			<h3 id="nativeCards">What are Mobile Native Cards?</h3>
			<p>Mobile native cards are UI Integration Cards that run within native Android and iOS applications.</p>

			<h3 id="supportedApplications">Supported Applications</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>SAP Mobile Start:</strong> Enterprise mobile portal that hosts and displays cards alongside other business content.</li>
				<li><strong>Joule for Mobile:</strong> AI-powered digital assistant that leverages cards for interactive business insights.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="limitations">Feature Parity and Limitations</h3>
			<p>Most card properties are supported on mobile native platforms, with a few exceptions. These exceptions are marked throughout the documentation and fall into one of the following categories:<p>
			<ul>
				<li>“Not applicable for mobile native cards.” - has no effect for mobile native integration cards.</li>
				<li>“Not yet implemented for mobile native cards.” - this feature is currently not implemented, but might be implemented in the future.</li>
				<li>“Not supported for mobile native cards.” - this feature can not be supported on mobile native platforms.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="considerations">Additional Considerations for Mobile Native Platforms</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Only declarative card types are supported. Cards of type Adaptive, Component and WebPage are not supported.</li>
				<li>JS Extensions are generally supported, but they must adhere to the basic card facade API provided within the extension.<br>
					The extension must be tested on a mobile native platform before it is productively released.</li>
				<li>Certain web-specific APIs may not be available.</li>
				<li>Some advanced animations or transitions may be simplified.</li>
				<li>Network requests adhere to mobile application security guidelines.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="note">Mobile native cards prioritize a native user experience while maintaining the core card functionality and consistent theming and design representation.</p>
