	 * @typedef {object} module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.SuiteConfiguration
	 *
	 * @property {string} [name]
	 *     Name of the test suite.
	 *
	 *     This name is used as the title of the index page / testsuite page.
	 *
	 * @property {module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.TestConfiguration} [defaults]
	 *     An Object with default settings for all tests.
	 *
	 *     The defaults and the test configuration are merged recursively in such a way
	 *     that the merge contains properties from both the defaults and the test config.
	 *     If a property is defined by both config objects, the value from the test config is used.
	 *     There's no special handling for other types of values, e.g an array value in the defaults
	 *     is replaced by an array value in the test config.
	 *
	 * The test starter applies the following complete default configuration structure:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * {
	 *   name: null,
	 *   beforeBootstrap: null,
	 *   module: "./{name}.qunit",
	 *   page: "resources/sap/ui/test/starter/Test.qunit.html?testsuite={suite}&test={name}",
	 *   title: "QUnit tests '{name}' of suite '{suite}'",
	 *   qunit: "edge",
	 *   sinon: "edge",
	 *   coverage: {
	 *     only: null,
	 *     never: null,
	 *     branchTracking: false,
	 *     instrumenter: "auto"
	 *   },

	 *     bindingSyntax: "complex",
	 *     libs: []
	 *   },
	 *   bootCore: true,
	 *   autostart: true
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @property {Object<string,module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.TestConfiguration>} [tests]
	 *     A map with the individual test configurations, keyed by a unique test name.
	 *
	 *     There's no technical limitation for the length or the characters of the test names.
	 *     The name is used only in the overview page showing all tests of your suite.
	 *
	 *     By default, the name is also used to derive an ID for the module that contains the test cases.
	 *     We therefore recommend using names which are valid module IDs (no blanks, no special chars other than "/" or ".").
	 *     If you have multiple tests that execute the same module but with different configurations
	 *     (e.g. different QUnit versions or different URL parameters), you have to make up unique names
	 *     and manually configure the module IDs for them.
	 *
	 * The test starter applies the following complete default configuration structure:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * {
	 *   name: null,
	 *   beforeBootstrap: null,
	 *   module: "./{name}.qunit",
	 *   page: "resources/sap/ui/test/starter/Test.qunit.html?testsuite={suite}&test={name}",

	/**
	 * Defines the configuration options for a single test in a testsuite. The same structure is also used
	 * for the defaults of a testsuite.
	 *
	 * Some of the properties in this structure support placeholders for the name of the test (written
	 * as <code>{name}</code>) and the module ID of the testsuite (written as <code>{suite}</name>>).
	 * These placeholders are substituted before the test configuration is evaluated.
	 *
	 * Properties that represent UI5 module IDs also support relative module IDs (starting with <code>./</code>).
	 * They are resolved relative to the package that contains the testsuite. This behaves the same as
	 * if the testsuite module would use these IDs in its <code>sap.ui.define</code> call.
	 *
	 * The test starter applies the following complete default configuration structure:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * {
	 *   name: null, // Derived from test key
	 *   beforeBootstrap: null,
	 *   module: "./{name}.qunit",

	 *     libs: []
	 *   },
	 *   bootCore: true,
	 *   autostart: true
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @typedef {object} module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.TestConfiguration
	 *
	 * @property {string} [group]
	 *     The name of a group to which the test belongs.
	 *
	 *     This is an optional string by which all tests in a testsuite will
	 *     be sorted and grouped when they are listed in a UI. The group name
	 *     usually is shown as a prefix of the test name.
	 *
	 * @property {boolean} [skip]
	 *     Whether the test starter should skip a test file. Such tests will remain in the overview list
	 *     but won't be executed in the test suite.
	 *
	 * @property {string} [name]
	 *     Name of the test. If omitted, it is derived from the corresponding key in the ´tests` object
	 *     of the enclosing suite.
	 *
	 * @property {string} [beforeBootstrap]
	 *     A module to be executed before the UI5 framework is bootstrapped.
	 *
	 *     This can be useful for setting up global configurations or mocks that need to exist
	 *     before any UI5 code runs.
	 *
	 *     The value can be a relative module ID (e.g., `./mySetup.js`) and may use the placeholders
	 *     <code>{name}</code> for the test name and <code>{suite}</code> for the suite name.
	 *
	 * @property {string|Array<string>} [module="./{name}.qunit"]
	 *     ID(s) of the module(s) to load.
	 *
	 *     Can either be a single string or an array of strings. Each given module ID can be a
	 *     relative module ID (relative to the package that contains the testsuite) and may use
	 *     the placeholders <code>{name}</code> and <code>{suite}</code>.
	 *
	 *     By default, a single module with the same name as the test and in the same
	 *     package as the testsuite is loaded.
	 *
	 * @property {sap.ui.core.URI} [page="resources/sap/ui/test/starter/Test.qunit.html?testsuite={suite}&test={name}"]
	 *     URL of the test page to start for this test.
	 *
	 *     By default, all tests use the generic starter page, which reads the suite
	 *     configuration, finds the tests, and starts the configured test components
	 *     before it requires and executes the configured test module(s).
	 *
	 *     The URL must either be relative to the application root or use the ui5:// protocol
	 *     with a module name. The URL can use the following placeholders, enclosed in curly braces:
	 *       {suite} - replaced by the name of the testsuite (configuration)
	 *        {name} - replaced by the name of the current test
	 *
	 *     By default, a generic test page uses the testsuite and test names as URL
	 *     parameters `testsuite` and `test`, respectively.
	 *
	 * @property {Object<string,string|string[]>} [searchParams]
	 *     A map-like object with URL parameters that are appended to the <code>page</code> URL.
	 *     Making this a separate property allows to use the same page URL for all tests but with
	 *     different URL parameters per test.
	 *
	 *     Keys in the object are parameter names, and their values represent the parameter values. If the value
	 *     for a parameter is an array, the parameter will be added multiple times, once for each value
	 *     in the array.
	 *
	 *     Non-string values are not recommended and are cast to string (using the standard JavaScript
	 *     `toString` functionality).
	 *
	 * @property {Object<string,string|string[]>} [uriParams]
	 *     A map-like object with URL parameters that are appended to the <code>page</code> URL.
	 *     {@deprecated As of version 1.141.0, use <code>searchParams</code> instead.}
	 *
	 * @property {string} [title]
	 *     Title of the test.
	 *
	 *     The title can use the following placeholders, enclosed in curly braces:
	 *           {suite} - replaced by the name of the testsuite (configuration)
	 *            {name} - replaced by the name of the current test
	 *
	 *     By default, a title is chosen which contains the names of the testsuite and the test.
	 *     The exact text is not specified and may change.
	 *
	 *     Default is "QUnit tests '{name}' of suite '{suite}'"
	 *
	 * @property {module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.QUnitConfiguration|null|false|number|"edge"} [qunit="edge"]
	 *     Whether QUnit should be started, what version of it should be used, and what configuration should
	 *     be applied. Details are described in the {@link module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.QUnitConfiguration} type.
	 *
	 *     The values <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>"edge"</code> as well as any numerical value
	 *     are shortcut notations for <code>qunit: { version: &lt;value&gt; }</code>.
	 *
	 *     Default is to use the "edge" version without any additional configuration.
	 *
	 * @property {module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.SinonConfiguration} [sinon="edge"]
	 *     Whether Sinon should be started, what version of it should be used, and what configuration should
	 *     be applied. Details are described in the {@link module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.SinonConfiguration} type.
	 *
	 *     The values <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>"edge"</code> as well as any numerical value
	 *     are shortcut notations for <code>sinon: { version: &lt;value&gt; }</code>.
	 *
	 *     Default is to use the "edge" version with a QUnit bridge, but without fake timers and fake servers.
	 *
	 * @property {module:sap/ui/test/starter/config.CoverageConfiguration} [coverage]
	 *     Code coverage options.
	 *
	 *     The qunit-coverage/qunit-coverage-istanbul module is always loaded after QUnit has been
	 *     loaded to enable the coverage option. When the 'coverage' parameter is set in the URL (e.g.
	 *     because the `coverage` checkbox has been clicked), then "blanket" (if Istanbul is not used
	 *     instead) will be loaded before qunit-coverage to avoid its synchronous loading.
	 *
	 *     The `instrumenter` property identifies which tool for code coverage should be used.
	 *     If "auto" is chosen, a check determines whether Istanbul and its middleware are available,
	 *     and if so, they will be loaded. Otherwise, "blanket" is used as a fallback.
	 *
	 *     The default is to automatically determine the instrumenter to use ("auto") and not to use
	 *     branch tracking.
	 *
	 * @property {Object<string,any>} [loader]
	 *     Configuration options for the ui5loader.
	 *
	 *     The configured object value is given to the {@link sap.ui.loader.config} API and supports
	 *     nearly all configuration options that are documented for that API.
	 *     The only exception is the async flag, which is already set to true by the test starter.
	 *     The ui5loader doesn't support switching back to sync mode (async:false).
	 *
	 * @property {Object<string,any>} [ui5]
	 *     UI5 runtime configuration options.
	 *
	 *     Any configured property is made available to the runtime as if it was given in the
	 *     <code>window["sap-ui-config"]</code> config object.
	 *     If a value is of a type not supported for window["sap-ui-config"], executing the UI5 core
	 *     might fail. As the only current exception, the "libs" property can be an array of library
	 *     names and not only a comma-separated string.
	 *
	 *     To ease test development, the test starter applies the following defaults.
	 *     Note that any default is only applied if the corresponding property has not been
	 *     defined in the test-specific configuration.
	 *     <ul>
	 *       <li><code>bindingSyntax: "complex"</code></li>
	 *     </ul>
	 *
	 * @property {boolean} [bootCore=true]
	 *     Whether the UI5 core (sap/ui/core/Core.js) should be required and booted.
	 *
	 *     When this option is true, the core is not only loaded and started, but loading and execution
	 *     of the test module(s) is also delayed until a listener registered with sap.ui.getCore().attachInit()
	 *     has been executed.
	 *
	 *     {@deprecated As of version 1.120, it should not be used in new tests}
	 *
	 * @property {boolean} [autostart=true]
	 *     Whether the test starter should call QUnit.start() after all prerequisites have been fulfilled
	 *     (e.g. QUnit, Sinon, a bridge, have been loaded, coverage tooling has been loaded and configured,
	 *     the Core has been booted, the test modules have been loaded and executed, any Promises returned by
	 *     the test modules have been resolved).

	 *
	 *     Allows for easier switch between different QUnit versions for tests by simply
	 *     changing the <code>version</code> property in the test configuration. The test starter then
	 *     uses the versions map to find the correct files for the requested version.

	 *     (e.g. "edge" as an alias for a concrete version).
	 *
	 *     By default, the map contains entries for the keys 1, 2, "edge" (same as 2) and "true"
